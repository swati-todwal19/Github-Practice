1. Git Stash - You are working on a feature, but suddenly need to switch branches.
Your work is unfinished and you don’t want to commit it yet.

Solution: git stash

Command:
git stash


What it does:

Temporarily saves all uncommitted changes (staged and unstaged)

Restores your working directory to the last commit state

Example:
git add index.html
git stash


Your index.html changes are saved in stash

Working directory is now clean

You can safely switch branches

Apply Stash Back:

Pop – Restore and remove from stash

git stash pop


Restores changes and removes them from stash

Apply – Restore but keep in stash

git stash apply


Restores changes but keeps them in stash

Git Cherry-Pick – Pick a specific commit
